          {`I have experience working on various projects, such as developing a website using React,
          NextJS, and TypeScript at GetPaid. Additionally, I participated in two hackathons: the
          Appetizer Hackathon organized by Naver Cloud and the Code Dojo hosted by Ninja Van.
          Furthermore, as part of my Project Management module in school, I successfully created a
          Swift Application. Moreover, I also built a full stack MERN cinema booking system as part
          of another module. Keep an eye out for my upcoming projects! `}
